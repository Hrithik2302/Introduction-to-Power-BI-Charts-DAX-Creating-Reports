The analytics team is tasked with drawing actionable insights from this data to improve lifestyle suggestions and prevent heart-related risks. Your Task: Using the provided dataset (includes Age, Gender, BMI, Steps, Calories, Sleep, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Smoking, Alcohol, Exercise, Diabetic & Heart Disease status): Build a one-page Power BI dashboard that answers: 1. Are users maintaining a balanced lifestyle (Steps, Sleep, Calories) 2. What lifestyle patterns (Smoking, Alcohol, BMI, etc.) indicate heart disease risk? 3. Is there any visible relationship between Sleep and Physical Activity? 4. How does BMI vary across Age Groups and Genders? 5. What is the impact of smoking and alcohol on heart rate and blood pressure? 6. Segment people based on their health activity to suggest lifestyle changes DATASET LINK: Health_activity_data"
